# wofi-gopass
A very simple wrapper script to glue together `wofi` and `gopass`.

This script is inspired by the [wofi-pass](https://gitlab.com/muhq/wofi-pass) utility and aims to be a simplified version tailored specifically to `gopass`.

## Usage

The script uses `wofi` and `wl-copy` to provide a Wayland-native way to interact with [gopass](https://www.gopass.pw).

## Installation

You can just drop the script into the '$PATH' or install it as a package from build.opensuse.org.
